# MLGEO2024_AObuoypredict
Autumn 2024 project to predict buoy positions in the Arctic Ocean

## Motivation
The dynamics of the Arctic Ocean environment are complex and variable. The International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) is a collaborative effort to deploy and maintain a network of drifting buoys in the Arctic Ocean to collect oceanographic and meteorological data that support research for a variety of applications. While the buoys can provide real-time and historical information on their location and in-situ environment, predicting the motion of these drifting buoys is challenging. Predictions of
